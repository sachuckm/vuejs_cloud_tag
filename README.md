To generate the Cloud Tags i used a vue component which is available in https://github.com/nobalmohan/vue-tag-cloud though i used a public vue componet its not straight forward so i modified as i want for this project.

for functinal testing i used nightWatch.js and jest for unit test cases as am not aware of unit test cases for front end i managed to learn and added some cases may be i missed some test cases.
Show words with random size and random color and when select any one word fetch respective transactions done based on some rules
